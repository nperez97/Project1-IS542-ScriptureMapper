## Nefi Perez - IS 542
I learned several things through the course of this project. I was able to both learn and reinforce some class concepts and also learn from some challenges that I faced in creating this project.


### What I Learned:
* IIFE: I have never really used IIFEs, and so using those on this project helped me better solidify in my mind how they work. Also, somewhat going along with this, using `=>` was good to practice since I had seen it before, but it always seemed more of an abstract concept in my mind and was/is still kind of hard for me to grasp and clearly see parallels of code that doesn't use it, but performs the same function.
* Google Documentation: I learned a lot about the Map API and how to use methods that are provided to the Map and Marker classes that I could use in my code. (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference)

### What was Challenging:
* Debugging: I knew to use the debugger and JSLint to help solve issues I ran into, but there were times were I had to spend a long time trying to find an error that wouldn't show up. I have now learned to be more aware of my spellings of when an 's' is included at the end.
