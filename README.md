## Nefi Perez - IS 542 - Project 2

### What I Learned:
* Media Queries: It was cool to see for myself how they work in making a website responsive to different device types. I had never really used them before, and so this project really helped me increase my understanding of them.
* jQuery: I think we had briefly touched on jQuery in passing in IS 413. Learning how to use jQuery to animate was certainly new for me, and is something I hope to continue to learn more about so I can implement it's animation feature in future projects.

### What was Challenging:
* Connecting HTML Script Content to JS file. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to connect my code so that I could implement the `nextContent()` so that I could slide between chapters. After a long time, I decided to go with the cross fade since I think you mentioned in class, that was allowed too. 

* I had also spent a long time trying to work with Grid for my CSS. I ran into weird issues when inserting content into parent divs, and after lots of spinning my wheels, I resorted to using flex, which seemed to be what you had originally in your project 1 starter code. 

### Feedback from others:
* Backbutton: Those who tested my site, liked the breadcrumb navigation, but would have also liked a back arrow as well.
